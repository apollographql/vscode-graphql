# {TEMPLATE} REST Connector

This connector currently covers the {XXX object/functionality} in the {TEMPLATE} API.

## Prerequisites

To use the connector, you need {API key or other prereq}.

## Additional Setup for VS Code Task runner

Edit your `.vscode/settings.json` to include the following keys:

```
{
  "terminal.integrated.profiles.osx": {
    "graphos": {
      "path": "zsh",
      "args": ["-l"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "",
        "APOLLO_KEY": "",
        ...
      }
    }
  },
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "graphos"
}
```

Once you've set this up, you can execute the `Tasks: Run Task` command in VS Code to run the `rover dev` task.
Alternatively, you can open a new terminal window in VS Code with the `graphos` profile, then run `rover dev --supergraph-config supergraph.yaml --router-config router.yaml`.

## Contributing


The following schema modules can be added to this connector:

- Example 1
- Example 2

To contribute them, make sure to:

1. Add a schema designed for the module as a new `.graphql` file.
2. Update the `router.yaml` and `supergraph.yaml` files accordingly.

See [REST API reference]() for other modules that can be implemented. You can use the current modules in this folder as examples to work with.
