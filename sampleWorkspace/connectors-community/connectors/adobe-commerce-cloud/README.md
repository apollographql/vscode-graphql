This connector is an example of how you could connecto to Magento Adobe Commerce Cloud instance. We were unable to validate all aspects of this connector due to an error warming up the local instance. We are working on getting a running instance to validate against.

In the short term, we used `prism mock ./swagger.json` to mock out the local API contents.
