# Pokeapi REST Connector

This connector currently covers the Pokemon, locations, moves and games in the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Additional Setup for VS Code Task runner

Edit your `.vscode/settings.json` to include the following keys:

```
{
  "terminal.integrated.profiles.osx": {
    "graphos": {
      "path": "zsh",
      "args": ["-l"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "",
        "APOLLO_KEY": "",
        ...
      }
    }
  },
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "graphos"
}
```

Once you've set this up, you can execute the `Tasks: Run Task` command in VS Code to run the `rover dev` task.
Alternatively, you can open a new terminal window in VS Code with the `graphos` profile, then run `rover dev --supergraph-config supergraph.yaml --router-config router.yaml`.
