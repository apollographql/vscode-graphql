# USPS REST Connector

This connector currently covers the [Tracking object](https://developer.usps.com/trackingv3) in the [USPS REST API](https://developer.usps.com/). To use this, you'll need to add a `API_KEY` in your environment variables then running `rover` or the `router` with the config files in this folder. 

## Additional Setup for VS Code Task runner

Edit your `.vscode/settings.json` to include the Strapi specific keys

```
{
  "terminal.integrated.profiles.osx": {
    "graphos": {
      "path": "zsh",
      "args": ["-l"],
      "env": { 
        "API_KEY": "",
        "APOLLO_KEY": "",
        ...
      }
    }
  },
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "graphos"
}

```

Then you can execute the "Tasks: Run Task" command in VS code to execute the `rover dev` task or simply open a new terminal window in vscode with the `graphos` profile, then you can simply run `rover dev --supergraph-config supergraph.yaml --router-config router.yaml`.

## Contributing

The following schema modules need to include:

1. A schema designed for that portion of the rest API as a new `.graphql` file
2. Additions to the `router.yaml` and `supergraph.yaml` files

You can view the [USPS API Catalog](https://developer.usps.com/apis) for other modules to implement.
