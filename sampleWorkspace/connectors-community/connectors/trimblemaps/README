# TrimbleMaps REST Connector

This is an Apollo Connector that works with the TrimbleMaps API.
https://developer.trimblemaps.com/restful-apis/developer-guide/introduction/

To use this, you'll need to add the Trimble Maps `API_KEY` in your environment variables then running `rover` or the `router` with the config files in this folder. 

## Additional Setup for VS Code Task runner

Edit your `.vscode/settings.json` to include the Strapi specific keys

```
{
  "terminal.integrated.profiles.osx": {
    "graphos": {
      "path": "zsh",
      "args": ["-l"],
      "env": { 
        "API_KEY": "",
        "APOLLO_KEY": "",
        "APOLLO_GRAPH_REF": "",
      }
    }
  },
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "graphos"
}

```

Then you can execute the "Tasks: Run Task" command in VS code to execute the `rover dev` task or simply open a new terminal window in vscode with the `graphos` profile, then you can simply run `rover dev --supergraph-config supergraph.yaml --router-config router.yaml`.


## Query by address

Example usage:

```
query locationByAddress($address: String!, $city: String!, $state: String!) {
  locationByAddress(address: $address, city: $city, state: $state) {
    lat
    long
  }
}
```

Pass address, city and state as strings.
Works with North America addresses only

Example:
`1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC`

Returns:
```
{
  "data": {
    "locationByAddress": {
      "lat": "38.897675",
      "long": "-77.036547"
    }
  }
}
```

## Query By Lat/Long coordinates

Example usage:

```
query addressByGeo($lat: String!, $long: String!) {
  addressByGeo(lat: $lat, long: $long) {
    shortFormatted
    timezone
  }
}
```

Pass Lat, long as strings
Works worldwide and returns Address and Timezone

Example:
`48.8584° N, 2.2945° E is the Eiffel Tower`

Returns:
{
  "data": {
    "addressByGeo": {
      "shortFormatted": "2 Avenue Gustave Eiffel, 75007 Paris, Île-de-France, FR, Paris",
      "timezone": "GMT+1:00"
    }
  }
}


## Contributing

Currently this connector supports a portion of the single search API
https://developer.trimblemaps.com/restful-apis/location/single-search/single-search-api/.  There is an opporunity to build out and expose more of the single search parameters.

In addition, there are a few premium/paid access APIs that Trimble Maps has available such as Routing and Distance Matrix.
